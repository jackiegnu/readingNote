\section{Job Experience}
\subsection{March 2008\~{} December 2020, Samsung Electronics}

\subsubsection{January 2014\~{}December 2020}
\textbf{Beijing Samsung Communications Technology Research Co.,Ltd}

Back to Beijing China from Korea, I led two projects, and, I am responsible for 2 applications design, architecture and development.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{passwordless payment feature---}}

I led the second project on which I was a mainly developer, too.

This feature has been implemented by 2 middlewares to support both Alipay and Wechat Payment separately, since they are not compatible.
Those 2 middlewares are running only on Samsung Android devices.

Alipay and WeChat are the giant android application in China.
To support Alipay and Wechat using biometrics such as fingerprint to do passwordless payment,
I develop those middlewares to support Alipay and WeChat using biometrics technology on Samsung devices.
Also, I use TEE technology to persist user sensitive data and RSA key-pair.

The architecture of this feature consists of Android AIDL interface, Android Service, Android HIDL interface, Linux service daemon, CA\footnote{CA:Client Application} library
and TA\footnote{TA: Trusted Application}.

Those features run in 3 chipset vendors: Qualcomm, Samsung Exynos and MediaTek;

There are 2 passwordless payment stardards from Alipay and Tencent respectively as below:

\begin{itemize}
\item[1]{IIFAA}\footnote{IFAA: \url{http://ifaa.org.cn/}}
(International Internet Finance Authentication Alliance)

\item[2]{SOTER}\footnote{SOTER github: \url{https://github.com/Tencent/soter}}
is a biometric standard as well as a platform held by Tencent.
\end{itemize}

\item{\textbf{GlobalRoaming}}
GlobalRoaming is a complex Android application which includes user interface logic, Service provider, SoftSIM logic, Middleware between Modem and Applicaton Processor, Modem RIL, Modem Program etc.

This is the first project I led, and as a main role of design and development.

This application would be used when users go abroad to access the local data service from local telecom vendor.
IMSI profile data from telecom vendor are stored into TEE side for security reason, and implemented USIM related specifications of 3GPP to complete communicate to BSS.
During this project, I refered to and implemented ISO7816-4, ETSI TS 131-102/121, ETSI TS 135 208.

Also, I used cryptography alogrithm, such as RSA, AES, to exchange cipher key and encrypt/decrypt data/cipher.

Those features run in 3 chipset vendor: Qualcomm, Samsung Exynos and MediaTek;

It has been commercialized on Samsung devices since 2015, it was transfered to another subsidiary of Samsung;


\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{January 2012\~{}January 2014}
\textbf{Samsung electronics Korea Headquarter}

Joined the Global Mobility Program to move to Headquarter for working in Suwon Korea;

\begin{itemize}
\item{}During this two years working in Korea, worked with Korean colleague to develop
\textbf{Secure OS}\footnote{Secure OS: works in the secure mode of ARM with trustzone supported} based on Samsung Chipset Exynos.
This was my first time known about TEE(Trusted Execution Envirnment).
And, we conform with GlobalPlatform {\footnote {GlobalPlatform: https://globalplatform.org/}} specification to implement Secure OS.

I was responsible for Device Driver model development for secure OS. And, I designed and implemented secure LCD evaluation application. For that, I shared the quarter best employee award with my colleague.

\end{itemize}
